**Problem Statement**
Traditional online learning platforms struggle with inefficiencies in grading descriptive answers and providing personalized learning paths. Manual evaluations are time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Additionally, managing complex course hierarchies and tracking student progress require a scalable, efficient solution that can adapt to individual learning needs.

**Technology Stack**
The platform uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for efficient data handling, user management, and UI/UX. Flask (Python) is integrated for machine learning tasks. MongoDB stores hierarchical course data, while Git and GitHub manage collaboration. LLMs are employed to automate descriptive answer evaluation and feedback.

**Division of Responsibilities**
Frontend developers focused on building the UI using React.js, ensuring real-time progress tracking. Backend developers handled API development with Node.js and Express.js, while machine learning engineers integrated the msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b LLM via Flask for automated evaluations. DevOps handled deployment, ensuring smooth integration and collaboration.

**Problem Solved**
The platform automates descriptive answer grading using LLMs, eliminating manual grading inefficiencies. It also provides real-time progress tracking and analytics to enhance learning experiences. The scalable architecture ensures seamless handling of complex course structures, while personalized learning paths adapt based on student performance, improving educational outcomes.
